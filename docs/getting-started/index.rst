Welcome to tandem!

Tandem may be used in 2D and 3D and supports low-order as well as high-order spaces.
The specific configuration is selected at compile time, which is why tandem needs
to compiled from source.
If you have Docker installed, you might want to try the
:doc:`quick start <quick-start>` procedure.
Here, all required dependencies are already contained in a Docker image.
Otherwise, follow the :doc:`regular installation <installation/index>` procedure.

Once tandem is installed, try to run the :doc:`example problems <examples>`.
